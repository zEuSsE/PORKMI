The files contained in the "bin" directory (with the exception of
surf.ln; see below) are Linux binaries that perform the keypoint
detection and feature extraction, courtesy of the Oxford Visual
Geometry Group. The binaries used here are h_affine.ln, mser.ln, and
compute_descriptors.ln. The code in this sub-package is simply a C++
wrapper around those binaries. All of those binaries (which do indeed
get updates from time to time) are available on their group's website
at: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/index.html

We thank the original authors for making these binaries available.
